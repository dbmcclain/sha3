;;;; %File Description:
;;;; 
;;;; This file contains the implementation of mid- and high-level
;;;; SHA-3 functions based on the optimized Keccak implementations.
;;;; 
;;;; The main entry points are the mid-level functions sha3-init,
;;;; sha3-update and sha3-final to initialize, update and finalize an
;;;; sha3 hash, and sha3-copy in order to copy a sha3 state.
;;;;
;;;; For convenience high-level functions to hash a given vector,
;;;; stream or file are provided as sha3-digest-vector,
;;;; sha3-digest-stream and sha3-digest-vector.
;;;;
